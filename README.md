I am struggling

Based off the lucid tensorflow 2d Neural style transfer example found here: https://github.com/tensorflow/lucid
The original example provided there no longer works, but I found a solution so I am reuploading it. . EDIT: A NEW FATAL ERROR RECENTLY BEGIN OCCOURING: NotImplementedError: Cannot convert a symbolic Tensor (2nd_target:0) to a numpy array 
THIS IS NOW FIXXED AND THE CODE IS 100% WORKING AGAIN

This uses lucid googlenet library /w CPPN. produces more mystical results with higher entropy

note: 
------------------------------------
images may require slight modification before they are uploaded, which are listed below, 
Using mspaint the modifications needed take less than 20 seconds total. (for both images)

1) - your initial image must be named the following before you upload: 1.jpg

2) - your style image must be named the following before you upload: 2.jpg 

3) - both images must not have any extra layers, (ie transparency) so this is why I have jpg enforced now, 
png are supported however.
------------------------------------

changes/improvements/features:
-----------------------------------------------
1)- runs online, no installation or even a python enviroment required.

2)- no programming experience or code modification needed

3)- automatic upload photo button and UI. no typing needed. all done with just a couple clicks.

4)- instant preview of your modifications, (get the hang quickly of what each thing does)

5)- no image size limitation/truncation, HD images supported. 

6)- insanely fast results, especially for large images, doesnt require 500+ iterations like others

7)- ability to modify/add/subtract layers to customize style parameters.

8)- added support for 26 other neural-nets/imagenets, and all their layers. (100+ new) this has never been done by any other projects.

9)- fixxed all errors, automatically acquires & sets correct dependencies

10)- enhanced backward compatability, runtime is now also python-3 compatable  

11)- added helpful tips in code to show when to go to next step (etc)
